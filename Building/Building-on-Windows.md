# Overview

## Before You Start

You should be at least moderately comfortable with Git, CMake, and the Windows command prompt before relying on this method. It requires a good bit of free hard drive space due to the large amount of dependencies required for the build (see below) and is meant for programmers that want to help us discover and fix programming errors.  When in doubt go for [binaries](Home) instead!

# How to Build Barrier under Windows

*as of 18 July 2018*

I am using Windows 10 64-Bit English 1803 (OS Build 17134.112).

- install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
  - Select Desktop development with C++
- install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- install [Qt (Open Source)](https://www.qt.io/download)
    - download the installer
    - on the select components screen, check the Qt version you want, I used `5.11.1`
- install [Bonjour SDK for Windows](https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/)
    - requries an account to download
    - *warning:* will install into `Program Files` regardless
- download the Barrier source code
    - either clone it via Git
    - or download the release archive and extract it
- edit lines 4--8 in `clean_build.bat` accordingly, these are mine:

      set B_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
      set B_QT_ROOT=E:\dev\Qt
      set B_QT_VER=5.11.1
      set B_QT_MSVC=msvc2017_64
      set B_BONJOUR=C:\Program Files\Bonjour SDK

- open a *Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017*
    - Start > Programs > Visual Studio 2017 > Visual Studio Tools > Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017
- navigate to the Barrier folder
- invoke `clean_build.bat`

If everything went well you should now have a working `barrier.exe` inside `build/bin/Debug`.
I don't know whether a release build built this way is deployable.

## Customization

You will likely need to tweak a few knobs to complete the build. The easiest way to override build paths locally is to create a file called winbuild_env.bat in the root of your Barrier tree. This file is sourced before any build commands are executed so it's a good place to put environmental overrides. The most common ones are B_QT_ROOT to tell the build where your MSVC Qt folder is, and B_BUILD_TYPE when you're ready for your Release build.

    set B_QT_ROOT=E:\Qt\5.6.3\msvc2015_64

    REM Uncomment when ready for a release build
    REM set B_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Isn't open-source wonderful? :)
